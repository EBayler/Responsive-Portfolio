                <p> I am a super random nerd that loves to try to find the best way to do every thing. I'm
                    always good for a laugh but know when it's time to get down to business. While I am new to coding I have
                    worked in tech for most of my life and have found the fastest way to learn how to fix something is be
                    willing to break it.</p> <br>
                <p>I currently work at Arapahoe Libraries at their Southglenn Library branch. I am a Library Specialist Lead
                    / Branch Volunteer Coordinator. My whole job is making sure that everything inside of the library runs
                    smooth and all of the staff are well trained and have complete backup from me and each other.</p>
